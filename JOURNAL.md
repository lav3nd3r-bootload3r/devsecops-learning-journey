# DevSecOps Learning Journey - Daily Journal

## Day 1 - Monday September 15, 2025 COMPLETE   

## Morning Setup (10am-2pm)
**Environment Configuration:**
- âœ… WSL2 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS setup complete
- âœ… Python 3.10.12 + pip + git installed  
- âœ… VS Code connected with WSL extension
- âœ… GitHub repository created: `lav3nd3r-bootload3r/devsecops-learning-journey`

**First Script Achievement:**
- âœ… Created `system_info_collector.py` - basic security audit tool
- âœ… Debugged syntax errors independently (f-string issues)
- âœ… Successfully committed and pushed to GitHub
- âœ… Set up secure GitHub authentication with Personal Access Token (30-day expiration)

### Afternoon Accomplishments (2pm-4pm)
**Documentation & Workflow:**
- âœ… Set up Markdown learning journal structure (JOURNAL.md, PROGRESS.md, RESOURCES.md)
- âœ… Emily confirmed Markdown is excellent choice for DevSecOps documentation
- âœ… Learned VS Code integrated Git workflow (Source Control panel)

**Troubleshooting Experience:**
- âœ… Solved VS Code file saving issue with Emily's help (restart required)
- âœ… Used VS Code commit features instead of command line for efficiency

### Key Learning Moments
- **Syntax Precision Matters:** Small typos in f-strings cause big problems
- **Security First:** 30-day token expiration better than 90-day  
- **Documentation as Code:** Markdown in repo confirmed by Emily as professional standard
- **Real-world troubleshooting:** VS Code + WSL sometimes needs restart for file saves
- **Workflow optimization:** VS Code integrated Git > command line for routine commits
